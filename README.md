Project Report
Title: Predictive Analytics for EV Charging Station Optimization
Technology Stack: Django, Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Leaflet.js
1. Introduction
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, necessitating efficient charging infrastructure. This project aims to optimize the placement and usage prediction of EV charging stations using predictive analytics and clustering techniques. It combines real-time station data with time series forecasting models to assist in planning and usage optimization.

2. Objectives
Predict future usage of EV charging stations using LSTM models.

Cluster charging stations based on location to identify usage trends.

Visualize station clusters and predicted usage on an interactive map.

Provide a scalable backend API using Django for easy integration.

3. Methodology
3.1 Data Sources
Historical usage data of EV charging stations (CSV file).

Real-time station location data fetched from external APIs (via fetch_station_data()).

3.2 Data Preprocessing
Sorted by station ID.

Normalized using MinMaxScaler from Scikit-learn.

Created sequences of 30 days for time series modeling.

3.3 Model â€“ LSTM
Implemented using PyTorch.

LSTM layers capture temporal usage patterns.

Trained to predict usage for the next 10 days.

Predicted values are inverse transformed to get real usage counts.

3.4 Clustering
Used KMeans to group nearby charging stations based on latitude and longitude.

Added cluster labels to each station.

Annotated one representative usage prediction across clusters.

3.5 Visualization
Used Leaflet.js for an interactive web map.

Each station is marked, color-coded by cluster, and displays predicted usage when clicked.

4. System Architecture
Frontend: Leaflet.js-based map for visualization (optional; not detailed here).

Backend: Django REST APIs

/predict-usage/: Predicts EV station usage for the next 10 days.

/fetch-stations/: Returns clustered stations annotated with predicted usage.

ML Engine: PyTorch LSTM model for forecasting.

Clustering Module: Scikit-learn-based KMeans clustering of locations.

5. Key Features
10-day usage forecast for better station planning.

Geographical clustering for demand analysis.

Interactive visualization ready for integration.

Scalable Django backend with clean API structure.

6. Challenges Faced
Managing non-interactive backends for Matplotlib in a Django environment.

Handling missing or incorrectly formatted historical usage data.

Ensuring predictions remain meaningful with generalized data across stations.

7. Future Enhancements
Predict usage per station instead of a general pattern.

Integrate real-time usage data from IoT devices or APIs.

Use advanced clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) for better geographical grouping.

Implement user access control and dashboards.

8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning and spatial clustering can be combined to support infrastructure planning for EV charging stations. The predictive model provides forward-looking insights, while clustering enhances spatial understanding, making it a powerful tool for urban EV infrastructure optimization.
